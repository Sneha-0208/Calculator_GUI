# Calculator_GUI
I have developed a Calculator using the Tkinter library of Python.
This calculator allows you to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo division on the integers.
It makes use of the Tkinter library of python to generate the interface of the calculator using various inbuilt classes and functions like Button, geometry, Text etc.
It uses the eval function to evaluate the expressions given in the form of string.
